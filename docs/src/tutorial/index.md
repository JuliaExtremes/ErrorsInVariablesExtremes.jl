# Tutorial

This tutorial shows the functionalities of *ErrorsInVariablesExtremes.jl*. They are illustrated by producing an Extreme Value Analysis of unobserved riverflows at ungauged section of the Chaudi√®re River.

Before executing this tutorial, make sure to have installed the following packages:
- *ErrorsInVariablesExtremes.jl* (of course)
- *Extremes.jl* (for more Extreme Value Analysis tools)
- *DataFrames.jl* (for using the DataFrame type)
- *Distributions.jl* (for using probability distribution objects)
- *Gadfly.jl* (for plotting)
- *CSV.jl* (to load CSV files)

and import them using the following command:
 ```@repl
using ErrorsInVariablesExtremes, Extremes, Dates, DataFrames, Distributions, Gadfly, CSV
```
