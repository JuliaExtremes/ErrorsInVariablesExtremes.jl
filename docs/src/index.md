# Extreme value analysis for errors-in-variables models

*ErrorsInVariablesExtremes.jl* provides exhaustive high-performance functions for the analysis of extreme values in errors-in-variables models in Julia. In particular, methods for pseudodata models are implemented, such as:
* Parameter estimation by Bayesian procedure.
* Stationary and non-stationary models.
* Diagnostic plots for assessing model accuracy.
* Model selection with deviance information criterion (DIC). 

The Tutorial section illustrates the package functionalities by producing an extreme value analysis of unobserved riverflows for a section of the Chaudière River in Québec, Canada.
